## Requirements

Requires [*NodeJS*](https://nodejs.org/en/) version `v20.11` or higher.

## Installation

```
npm install -g pmpact
```

### Installation from the repo

Clone the repo and from the root execute:

```
npm install
npm link
```

**Note**: Don't forget to run `npm unlink` if needed!

## Command line usage

### From a url

```
pmpact http://pact-broker/provider/a-provider/consumer/a-consumer/latest
```

### From a file

```
pmpact pact-file.json
```

### Save to a file

```
pmpact http://pact-broker/provider/a-provider/consumer/a-consumer/latest -o postman-collection.json
```

### From a url that requires headers

```
pmpact http://pact-broker/provider/a-provider/consumer/a-consumer/latest -H '{"Authorization":"Basic ZFhmbHR5Rk1n..."}'
```

## *Postman* usage

### Import the collection in *Postman*

Once you have a generated [*Postman* collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collections/intro_to_collections), select "import" in *Postman*. The generated collection format is `2.1`.

A collection should appear, starting with the name "Pact".

### Create a *Postman* environment

A url variable is used for all the requests. The next step is to create an [*Postman* environment](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/intro_to_environments_and_globals) with a url variable, for example: `url: http://my-service.com`.
